CSV-RoundUps
---
This is meant to be used with your bank/credit card statements in a CSV format.

It will calculate all of the purchases, round them to the nearest dollar
and give you that total. You can use that total to invest, or save.
---
Usage: roundup <directory or file.csv>

Not providing a path means the program will loop through the current directory.

Examples:
    Round up chase.csv               :  roundup chase.csv
    Round up transactions directory  :  roundup transactions
          """)
